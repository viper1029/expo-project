# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**Note**: This project uses `AGENTS.md` files for detailed guidance.

## Primary Reference

Please see `AGENTS.md` in this same directory for the main project documentation and guidance.

## Planning Expectations

When proposing work:

* Provide a **detailed, checkable plan** (not overly concise). Include key steps, dependencies, and expected outputs.
* Still keep the plan **scannable** (short bullet steps, clear ordering).
* Wait for explicit approval before changing code/config/docs.
