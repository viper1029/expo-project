## Essential Commands

### Development

```bash
npx expo start                  # Start dev server
npx expo start --clear          # Clear cache and start dev server
npx expo install <package>      # Install packages with compatible versions
npx expo install --check        # Check which installed packages need to be updated
npx expo install --fix          # Automatically update any invalid package versions
npm run development-builds      # Create development builds (workflow)
npm run reset-project           # Reset to blank template
```

### Building & Testing

```bash
npx expo doctor      # Check project health and dependencies
npx expo lint        # Run ESLint
npm run draft        # Publish preview update and website (workflow)
```

### Production

```bash
npx eas-cli@latest build --platform ios -s          # Use EAS to build for iOS platform and submit to App Store
npx eas-cli@latest build --platform android -s      # Use EAS to build for Android platform and submit to Google Play Store
npm run deploy                                      # Deploy to production (workflow)
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style & Standards

- **TypeScript First**: Use TypeScript for all new code with strict type checking
- **Naming Conventions**: Use meaningful, descriptive names for variables, functions, and components
- **Self-Documenting Code**: Write clear, readable code that explains itself; only add comments for complex business logic or design decisions
- **React 19 Patterns**: Follow modern React patterns including:
  - Function components with hooks
  - Enable React Compiler
  - Proper dependency arrays in useEffect
  - Memoization when appropriate (useMemo, useCallback)
  - Error boundaries for better error handling

### Navigation & Routing

- Use **Expo Router** for all navigation
- Import `Link`, `router`, and `useLocalSearchParams` from `expo-router`
- Docs: https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/

### Recommended Libraries

- **Navigation**: `expo-router` for navigation
- **Images**: `expo-image` for optimized image handling and caching
- **Animations**: `react-native-reanimated` for performant animations on native thread
- **Gestures**: `react-native-gesture-handler` for native gesture recognition
- **Storage**: Use `expo-sqlite` for persistent storage, `expo-sqlite/kv-store` for simple key-value storage

## Documentation Guidelines
- Keep repo-level docs high-level: describe flows, responsibilities, and decisions instead of listing file names or schema details.
- Avoid implementation-specific notes unless they unlock critical context; prefer inline code comments or README files co-located with the code for deep dives.
- Update architecture/feature docs only when the overall flow changes; minor refactors should not require doc edits.

## Agent Workflow Guardrails
- Clarify requirements before implementing when scope/behavior is ambiguous.
- Share a concise plan with checkable steps and wait for explicit approval before changing code/config/docs.
- Do not commit or push unless explicitly requested.
- Simplicity first: prefer the smallest change that solves the problem; avoid over-engineering.
- Demand elegance (balanced): for non-trivial changes, ask "is there a more elegant way?" but skip this for simple fixes.
- Root-cause fixes: avoid temporary hacks; address underlying issues when feasible.
- Verify before done: when relevant, compare behavior to `master`, run appropriate checks, and show evidence (tests, logs, or screenshots).
- Bug reports: diagnose from logs/tests first, propose the fix, and proceed only after approval.
- Lessons: if a correction is made, record the root cause and prevention note in the PR description or a short `history/` entry.

## Clarity & Options
- When requirements are unclear, first inspect the current codebase/state.
- Present 2-3 viable options with pros/cons and a recommended default.
- Ask the user to confirm or override the recommendation.

## Planning Notes (Optional)
- For multi-step work, keep short, date-stamped notes in `history/` if needed.
- Keep notes brief and avoid long-lived TODO lists.

## Debugging & Development Tools

### DevTools Integration

- **React Native DevTools**: Use MCP `open_devtools` command to launch debugging tools
- **Network Inspection**: Monitor API calls and network requests in DevTools
- **Element Inspector**: Debug component hierarchy and styles
- **Performance Profiler**: Identify performance bottlenecks
- **Logging**: Use `console.log` for debugging (remove before production), `console.warn` for deprecation notices, `console.error` for actual errors, and implement error boundaries for production error handling

### Testing & Quality Assurance

#### Automated Testing with MCP Tools

Developers can configure the Expo MCP server with the following doc: https://docs.expo.dev/eas/ai/mcp/

- **Component Testing**: Add `testID` props to components for automation
- **Visual Testing**: Use MCP `automation_take_screenshot` to verify UI appearance
- **Interaction Testing**: Use MCP `automation_tap_by_testid` to simulate user interactions
- **View Verification**: Use MCP `automation_find_view_by_testid` to validate component rendering

## EAS Workflows CI/CD

This project is pre-configured with **EAS Workflows** for automating development and release processes. Workflows are defined in `.eas/workflows/` directory.

When working with EAS Workflows, **always refer to**:

- https://docs.expo.dev/eas/workflows/ for workflow examples
- The `.eas/workflows/` directory for existing workflow configurations
- You can check that a workflow YAML is valid using the workflows schema: https://exp.host/--/api/v2/workflows/schema

### Build Profiles (eas.json)

- **development**: Development builds with dev client
- **development-simulator**: Development builds for iOS simulator
- **preview**: Internal distribution preview builds
- **production**: Production builds with auto-increment

## Troubleshooting

### Expo Go Errors & Development Builds

If there are errors in **Expo Go** or the project is not running, create a **development build**. **Expo Go** is a sandbox environment with a limited set of native modules. To create development builds, run `eas build:dev`. Additionally, after installing new packages or adding config plugins, new development builds are often required.

## AI Agent Instructions

When working on this project:

1. **Always start by consulting the appropriate documentation**:

   - For general Expo questions: https://docs.expo.dev/llms-full.txt
   - For EAS/deployment questions: https://docs.expo.dev/llms-eas.txt
   - For SDK/API questions: https://docs.expo.dev/llms-sdk.txt

2. **Understand before implementing**: Read the relevant docs section before writing code

3. **Follow existing patterns**: Look at existing components and screens for patterns to follow
